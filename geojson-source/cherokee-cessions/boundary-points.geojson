The fort itself had a short lifespan, not being completed until 1718 and then abandoned by 1722. The site continued its use as a trading center for some time, but fortification was no longer necessary due to improved relations with the Cherokees and Catawbas. (National Register application)\nThe Congarees seems to be the most likely location of the meeting between Governor Nicholson and the Cherokees in 1721 that resulted in what may have been the Cherokee’s first cession of land to Anglo-Americans.

{ "type": "Feature", "id": 17210101, "properties": { "name": "Savannah Town/Fort Moore", "confidence": "Low", "order": 1, "description": "Fort Moore was constructed in 1716 at the site of Savannah Town, several miles downstream of modern Augusta, Georgia. Named for the contingent of Savannah (alternatively Shawnee, Savano, Shawano) Indians who had inhabited the site since ousting the Westo in 1685, Savannah Town was an important trade hub and waypoint along the route to the native peoples of the Old Southwest.\nBy 1707, many Savannah Town Indians relocated to the Potomac (? Gathering Together). In 1715, the remaining Savannah Indians took part as belligerents in the pan-Indian Yamasee War and had departed the area by 1716. In response to Indian hostility and the loss of its buffer of friendly Indians at Savannah Town, South Carolina established Fort Moore at the site of the former town to safeguard trading activities. \nThe deputy governor of South Carolina wrote in (1718), \"I look upon Savano Garison as the key of our Settlement. It is the Storehouse where we lay our Arms, Ammunition and Necessaries for the Supply of the Cherikees, and other our Friendly Indians.” (Crane 1928, 188)\nThe site was eventually resettled by colonists and a contingent of Chickasaw Indians. With the establishment and growth of Augusta, Georgia in the 1730s and 1740s, Fort Moore’s relevance to the southern Indian trade declined, and the fort was abandoned by late 1763.
